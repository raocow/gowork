# gitplus: point the GitHub CLI at the right account for whatever directory
# this shell is in, using a PER-SHELL token rather than gh's global setting.
#
# Why per-shell: gh's "active account" (what `gh auth switch` sets) is a
# single setting shared by every terminal, session, and background agent on
# the machine. With more than one account in play, any of them switching it
# yanks the identity out from under all the others mid-task — the failure
# looks like a baffling "Unauthorized"/"Enterprise Managed User" error in a
# session that never touched its own auth. An earlier version of this file
# switched globally on every cd and so was itself a cause of that.
#
# Instead this exports GH_TOKEN for THIS shell only. gh honors it over the
# active account, so each terminal gets its own identity, concurrent sessions
# can't clobber each other, and gh's global setting is never written at all.
# Leaving a bound directory unsets it again — a clean restore, which the
# global version fundamentally couldn't do.
#
# Tradeoff worth knowing: the token sits in this shell's environment (visible
# to child processes and to `ps -E` as your own user) rather than only in the
# keychain. That's the standard GH_TOKEN mechanism CI uses, but it is a real
# difference from the keychain-only default.
#
# Note git is unaffected either way: it authenticates through the osxkeychain
# credential helper (or an ssh alias — see `gp account`), not through gh's
# active account, so `git push`/`git fetch` never depended on this.
#
# Unbound directories are bound AUTOMATICALLY, on evidence rather than a
# guess: the accounts differ in which repos they can reach, so the first one
# with PUSH access to this repo is bound and reported. Nothing happens when
# no account has push access (a public repo you only have READ on is never
# auto-bound) or outside a GitHub repo. That probe costs a network call, so
# it runs only for an unbound directory, once per directory per shell.
#
# Enable by adding to ~/.zshrc:
#   source "$(brew --prefix)/share/zsh/ghswitch.zsh"
