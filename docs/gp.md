# gitplus

Personal custom `git` subcommands. Git treats any executable named `git-<name>`
on your `PATH` as `git <name>`, so these work like built-ins once installed.

These are shortcuts to speed up a PR-based dev cycle: `git sweep` clears out
merged branches faster than asking an LLM to do it by hand; `git pr` + `git
done` is a quick way to check out and test a coworker's branch and clean up
afterward. If you don't work with PRs, there's probably not much here for you
— but if you work with a team, it's worth a look.

## Install

**Homebrew** (recommended):

```bash
brew tap raocow/tap
brew install gitplus
```

This also installs the [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com) (`gh`)
automatically — it's a hard dependency of the formula, needed for `git pr`
and `git haspr`.

**From source** (for local development, or if you're not on Homebrew):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/raocow/gitplus ~/gitplus
cd ~/gitplus
./install.sh                 # symlinks bin/git-* into ~/.local/bin
# (pass a dir to link elsewhere, e.g. ./install.sh ~/bin)
```

`./install.sh` symlinks, so a later `git pull` here updates the commands in
place. Make sure the target dir is on your `PATH`. You'll need the
[GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com) (`gh`) yourself this way — `install.sh`
installs it via Homebrew if missing (and prints manual instructions
otherwise); not fatal, so the other commands install fine without it.

## zsh completion

`install.sh` also symlinks a set of plain zsh completion functions into
`<target>/../share/zsh/site-functions` — real Tab-completion for every
command below (real branches, real open PRs — nothing generated or guessed,
same principle as `cd` completing real directories). No `source` line, no
compinit-ordering requirement: these autoload the standard way, so they just
work once that directory is on your `$fpath`.

`git new` is built specifically to fix chronically-verbose LLM-authored
branch names: `git new <TAB>` cycles through short *words already used in
this repo's existing branch names*, so composing a name is a few Tab presses
instead of typing a sentence — and it works no matter what's driving your
terminal (Claude, Codex, you by hand), since it fires on the completion
itself, not on any tool choosing to cooperate.

If `install.sh` doesn't detect that zsh's own `_git` wins, it prints a
one-time setup snippet. The subtlety: these are `git <subcommand>`
completions, so completing their arguments goes through whatever `_git` is
first on `fpath`. zsh's own `_git` dispatches to `_git-<cmd>` user functions
(how these work); the `_git` that **Homebrew's `git` formula** ships does
**not** — it sends unknown subcommands' arguments to plain file completion.
And `brew shellenv` prepends Homebrew's `site-functions` dir, so by default
brew's `_git` wins and `git pr list <TAB>` / `git new <TAB>` just list files.
The fix puts zsh's own function dirs back in front (so its `_git` wins) while
keeping the completion dir on `fpath`:

```zsh
typeset -U fpath
fpath=(/usr/share/zsh/${ZSH_VERSION}/functions /usr/share/zsh/site-functions "$COMPLETION_DIR" $fpath)
autoload -Uz compinit && compinit
```

(`$COMPLETION_DIR` is `install.sh`'s target, e.g.
`~/.local/share/zsh/site-functions`; with the Homebrew formula it's already
on `fpath` and you can drop it.)

## Commands

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| [`git sweep`](#git-sweep) | Delete local branches already merged into the base |
| [`git wsweep`](#git-wsweep) | Remove worktrees (and their branches) already merged into the base |
| [`git sync`](#git-sync) | Rebase branch(es) onto the base and push |
| [`git pr`](#git-pr) | List, check out, merge, close, or revert PRs |
| [`git new`](#git-new) | Create + switch to a branch, with short-name Tab-completion |
| [`git haspr`](#git-haspr) | Check whether a branch already has a PR |
| [`git done`](#git-done) | Switch back to base, fast-forward it, delete the branch you left |
| [`git swap`](#git-swap) | Check out a branch or worktree here, freeing it from another worktree first |
| [`git release`](#git-release) | Tag the current commit and publish a GitHub release for it |
| [`git account`](#git-account) | Tie directories to different git/ssh/GitHub identities |

Each takes `-h` for a short usage summary, or `--help` to open its full man
page (installed to `share/man/man1` by `install.sh` and by Homebrew).

### `git sweep`

```
git sweep [<branch>...] [-r|--remote] [-l|--local] [-f|--force] [-n|--dry-run] [-b|--base <name>]
```

- Fetches first and compares against the base's **remote tip**
  (`origin/<base>`) — works without pulling main, and from any branch.
- Safe by default: only deletes branches verified merged into that tip (via
  `merge-base`), so no unmerged work is lost — and unlike a bare
  `git branch -d`, it isn't fooled by a stale local base.
- `-f`/`--force` widens the scope to **every** local branch except base and
  current, and force-deletes (`-D`) — also clears never-PR'd, squash-merged,
  or genuinely unmerged branches (this can delete unmerged work — preview
  with `-n` first).
- Naming one or more branches sweeps just those instead of the whole repo —
  same safety rule (skipped unless merged, unless `-f`). Refuses to name the
  base or current branch.
- **Local by default.** `-r`/`--remote` sweeps branches on **origin** instead,
  under the same merged-into-base rule (judged against `origin/<branch>`,
  since a local copy can be stale or missing entirely). `-l`/`--local` is that
  default spelled out, and `-rl` does both — short flags bundle. Remote
  deletes go out as one push rather than one per branch.
- Deleting on origin is **shared state**, so `-n` prints it as its own
  section, and `-rf` — which force-deletes *unmerged* branches from the remote
  — is the one combination where a mistake affects everyone rather than being
  recoverable from your own reflog. Preview it.

### `git wsweep`

```
git wsweep [-f|--force] [-n|--dry-run] [-b|--base <name>]
```

The worktree analogue of `git sweep`:

- Removes worktrees whose **HEAD is already merged** into the base's remote
  tip, **and deletes the underlying branch** — same as running `git sweep`
  right after, since you're almost always done with both at once. A
  detached-HEAD worktree has no branch, so only the worktree goes.
- Safe by default (verified with `merge-base`; judged by the worktree's HEAD,
  so branch-backed and detached worktrees both work). The main worktree and
  the one you're in are never touched (or deleted).
- `-f`/`--force` removes **every** other worktree regardless of merge status
  — including ones with uncommitted changes (those changes are discarded).
  Branches are **not** deleted in force mode — that's two separately
  destructive actions to compound into one flag; run `git sweep -f`
  afterward if you want those gone too. Preview with `-n` first.

### `git sync`

```
git sync [<ids...>] [-x|--exclude <ids...>] [-a|--all] [-n|--dry-run] [-b|--base <name>]
```

- Rebases branch(es) onto `origin/<default>` and pushes:
  `fetch → rebase → push --force-with-lease`. Bare `git sync` does the
  current branch.
- **Targets mirror `git pr merge`**: a PR number, head branch, URL, or an
  `824-830`-style range, all mixable. A numeric/URL target resolves to the
  PR's head branch via `gh`; a plain branch name is used as-is, offline.
  `-x`/`--exclude` drops branch(es)/PR(s) from an explicit list or `--all`
  (same forms, ranges included).
- On the base branch (or a target that *is* the base), it acts as a safe pull
  instead — `fetch → rebase origin/<base>`, no push.
- **A rebase that can't complete automatically is handled like
  `git pr merge`**: it's aborted (branch left untouched, never
  half-rebased), skipped, and listed at the end as needing manual
  resolution — resolve one by hand with
  `git checkout <branch> && git rebase origin/<base>`.
- `--all`/`-a` sweeps the whole repo: fast-forwards local base, **prunes**
  branches already merged into it, and rebases + pushes the rest.
  Purely-local (never-pushed) branches are rebased but not pushed;
  squash-merged branches look unmerged so they're rebased, not pruned (use
  `git sweep -f` for those).
- Guards against dirty trees. No `--method` — sync only ever rebases.

### `git pr`

```
git pr                            list your open PRs ("<url> -- <title>")
git pr -nt                        list them as bare URLs (--no-title)
git pr -c                         also copy the listing to the clipboard (--copy)
git pr -g                         every open PR, every authed gh account (--global)
git pr <n|branch|url|.|@>         check out that PR, updated to its latest
git pr list <id...>               show title/link instead of checking out
git pr merge <id...>              merge the given PR(s)
git pr merge --all|-a             merge every mergeable PR YOU authored
git pr close <id...>              close the given PR(s) without merging
git pr unmerge <id...>            revert merged PR(s) — opens a revert PR
git pr ... -x|--exclude <id...>   exclude PR(s) from any of the above
git pr merge ... -n|--dry-run     preview the merge plan, change nothing
git pr merge <id...> -s|-m|-r     merge method for just those PRs
```

Requires the GitHub CLI (`gh`).

- **List** (bare `git pr`) shows your open PRs; `-nt`/`--no-title` prints
  bare URLs, one per line, for piping. `-c`/`--copy` also copies the listing
  to the clipboard — works with any listing form (`list`, `-nt`, `-g`), not
  `merge`.
- **List globally** with `-g`/`--global`: every open PR you have anywhere,
  under **every** gh account you're logged into — not just the active one,
  and not scoped to a repo, so it works outside one too. Each row is tagged
  with the account that owns it. This exists because with per-directory
  identities a plain `git pr` showing nothing only means the *active* account
  has nothing *here*, which looks identical to having no work in flight.
  Listing only: no ids, no `-x`, not valid with `merge`. Each account is
  queried with its own token, so it never touches `gh`'s active account.
- **Check out** a PR with its number, head branch, URL, or `.`/`@` (the
  branch you're on) — this runs `gh pr checkout`, which creates the branch or
  fast-forwards an existing one, so you're never on a stale copy. Falls back
  to `refs/pull/<n>/head` for a merged/closed PR whose branch was deleted,
  or — offline — to a local branch stamped with the PR number (switched to
  as-is, not updated). If the branch is already checked out in another
  worktree, it's freed from there first (see `git swap`) instead of refusing.
- **Inspect without checking out**: `git pr list <id...>` shows the
  title/link for any number of PRs, any author, any state. `.`/`@` works
  here too.
- **Ids that can't be a checkout are an error, not an implicit list.**
  `git pr <id>` checks out; anything that can't (2+ ids, a range, or `-x`)
  used to quietly list instead, so the same command shape did two unrelated
  things one character apart — `git pr 422` changed your working tree while
  `git pr 422-423` printed a list and touched nothing. That's too sharp a
  difference to hinge on argument count, so those forms now error and point
  at `git pr list`. Bare `git pr` with no ids still lists your open PRs.
- **Merge**: `git pr merge <id...>` merges exactly the PRs you name, whoever
  authored them — naming them is explicit, so it's not scoped to you.
  `git pr merge --all`/`-a` (no ids) is a broad sweep, so it's scoped to PRs
  **you authored** — it never touches anyone else's, and neither form ever
  bypasses branch protection.
  - Acts by default (it touches GitHub) — pass `-n`/`--dry-run` to preview
    the plan first.
  - Merges in an order that minimizes conflicts (least-entangled first, by
    shared changed files — a plain adjacency count, no LLM involved).
  - For each PR: a clean one merges directly; one needing an update is
    rebased in a scratch worktree (never touching your current branch) and
    pushed; blocked, draft, or unresolvable PRs are skipped.
  - `--method merge|squash|rebase` sets the method for the whole run
    (default: the repo's own). Branches aren't auto-deleted — run `git sweep`
    after.
  - **Per-PR method**: `-s`/`--squash`, `-m`/`--merge`, `-r`/`--rebase` — the
    same spellings `gh pr merge` uses. A method flag applies **backward**, to
    every id to its left that no other method flag already claimed;
    equivalently, each id takes the nearest method flag to its **right**, and
    an id with none takes the default. `-x` composes with it: a method flag
    ends an `-x` run like any other flag, and only ever claims targets, never
    excludes.

    ```
    git pr merge 12-31 --merge 42 43-51 -s   # 12-31 by merge commit,
                                             # 42 and 43-51 squashed
    git pr merge 1 2 -s 3                    # 1 and 2 squashed, 3 default
    ```

    `-n`/`--dry-run` lists the method chosen for each PR, so a mixed run is
    always checkable before it acts.
- **Close**: `git pr close <id...>` closes PRs *without* merging them — same
  id grammar as merge (numbers, branches, URLs, `NNN-MMM` ranges, `.`/`@`),
  and `-x` works the same. `--all`/`-a` closes every open PR **you authored**,
  same scoping rule as `merge --all`. `-n`/`--dry-run` previews.
  Closing is per-PR and reversible (reopen), so there's no ordering to compute
  and nothing to rebase — a failure on one PR is reported and the rest still
  proceed. Branches are left alone; `git sweep` handles those.
- **Unmerge**: `git pr unmerge <id...>` reverts PRs that already landed, by
  opening a **revert PR** for each (via `gh pr revert`) and printing its URL —
  merge that to actually undo the change. Delegating to GitHub is deliberate:
  it knows how each PR was merged, and the three methods need genuinely
  different reverts (a merge commit needs `-m 1`, a squash is one commit, a
  rebase is N commits with no single commit to undo), so reimplementing it
  locally would get the rebase case quietly wrong. It also lands as something
  reviewable that respects branch protection. Only accepts PRs in the MERGED
  state, and there is deliberately no `--all`.

### `git new`

```
git new <name> [-b|--base <base>]
```

Creates `<name>` and switches to it (`git switch -c`, from the current
branch unless `-b`/`--base` is given). The real point is Tab-completion: with
the zsh completions enabled, `git new <TAB>` cycles through short words
already used in this repo's branch names, so composing a short name takes a
few Tab presses instead of typing a sentence — and it works regardless of
what's driving the terminal, since it's the shell doing the completing, not
any tool choosing to cooperate.

### `git haspr`

```
git haspr [<branch>]
```

Requires the GitHub CLI (`gh`).

Checks whether a branch (current branch by default) already has a PR, in
**any state** — open, closed, or merged — so it catches one that already
landed or got closed before you create a duplicate. Prints the URL and state
and exits 0 if found; prints a clear message and exits 1 otherwise, so it's
usable in scripts: `git haspr || gh pr create`.

### `git swap`

```
git swap <branch|worktree|PR#|url|.|@>
```

A branch can only ever be checked out in **one worktree at a time** (a hard
git rule) — normally a hard stop: `git pr <id>`/`git sync <id>` just refuse
and tell you where it is. `git swap <id>` instead **frees it and checks it out
here**: it detaches the *other* worktree's HEAD at its current commit (safe —
doesn't touch that worktree's working tree or uncommitted changes at all,
just stops it holding the branch name) and switches to the branch in the
current worktree. A purely local operation — no shell integration needed,
since it never has to move you anywhere.

The id can be a branch name, a **worktree name** (its directory name or full
path), a PR number, a PR URL, or `.`/`@` (the current branch) — same grammar
as `git pr`/`git sync` plus the worktree form. Naming the worktree is often
what you actually remember; the branch inside it is the thing you were trying
to look up. A branch name wins if a branch and a worktree share a name, and a
detached worktree has no branch to find. A PR number/URL is resolved to its
head branch via `gh` first.

```
git swap feature-dir     # whatever branch that worktree holds
git swap modloop         # by branch name
git swap 132             # by PR number
``` `git pr <id>` uses the same free-it-first
logic internally, so `git pr 132` also just works even when #132's branch is
checked out elsewhere.

### `git done`

```
git done [-f|--force] [-n|--dry-run] [-b|--base <name>]
```

The bookend to `git pr`:

- Switches back to the base (`origin/<default>`, usually main),
  **fast-forwards it to origin** (so you land on an up-to-date main with the
  PR you just merged), and deletes the branch you left.
- Safe by default: only deletes the branch you left if it's actually merged
  into the base — checked explicitly (`git merge-base --is-ancestor`), **not**
  a bare `git branch -d`, which checks a branch's own upstream when it has
  one, not the base — so a merely-*pushed* branch (true of anything that's
  ever had a PR) would pass regardless of whether it was ever merged,
  silently dropping real work.
- **Squash- and rebase-merged branches are handled too**, and have to be:
  neither is an ancestor of the base (a squash is one new commit, a rebase
  rewrites them), so the ancestor test alone would refuse every branch forever
  in a squash-merging repo — the command never doing its job. When that test
  says no, GitHub is asked whether a PR from this branch into **this** base was
  merged. The base match is the point: a *stacked* PR merged into its parent
  branch hasn't reached the base, and is still correctly refused. Needs `gh`;
  offline it falls back to refusing, which is the safe direction.
- The fast-forward is best-effort: skipped with a note if you're offline or
  local base has diverged (never a merge commit).
- On a detached HEAD, it just switches back to base. Already on the base, it
  just pulls (fetch + fast-forward — nothing to delete).

### `git account`

```
git account add <name> --email <email> [--name <git name>] [--host <host>]
                       [--dir <path>] [--gh-user <user>]
git account bind <name> <dir>
git account list | key <name> | check
```

Two GitHub accounts — yours and an employer's — normally means remembering to
set `user.email` per clone and juggling ssh keys by hand. Set an account up
once and every repo under a bound directory commits as it, reaches the host
with its key, and (with `--gh-user`) has `gh` talk to GitHub as it.

```bash
git account add work --email me@work.com --dir ~/code/work --gh-user work-gh
# paste the printed key into that host account, then clone via the alias:
git clone git@github.com-work:acme/api.git ~/code/work/api
git account check
```

- **Nothing is sourced into your shell.** Git reads `includeIf` and ssh reads
  the `Host` alias on their own, so this is config plus a keypair. Edits are
  only ever *appended*, wrapped in `BEGIN`/`END` sentinel comments, and never
  rewritten in place — a botched rewrite of an ssh config can lock you out of
  every host you use. Existing keys, host blocks and identity files are left
  alone and reported, never clobbered.
- **`check` is the one worth running.** The main failure mode is silent:
  rename or move a bound directory and its `includeIf` points at a path that's
  gone, so git quietly falls back to your global identity and the wrong name
  lands on every commit with no error anywhere.
- **The other commands use this.** Each one resolves the account bound to the
  current directory and scopes its `gh` calls to that identity, so the right
  account is used no matter which shell, script or agent invoked it.
- **Optional shell hook**: `share/zsh/ghswitch.zsh` keeps `gh`'s identity
  matched to the directory you're in, per shell, by exporting `GH_TOKEN`
  rather than changing `gh`'s machine-wide active account. Source it from
  `~/.zshrc`. Without it the commands still resolve the right account
  themselves — the hook only helps bare `gh` commands you type by hand.

This was `devrig account` until gitplus came to depend on it. Config written
by that version is still read — the old `devrig:` sentinel prefix and the
current `gitplus:` one are both understood — so existing setups keep working
with no migration.

### `git release`

```
git release <version> [--notes <text>] [-n|--dry-run]
git release --major|--minor|--patch [--notes <text>] [-n|--dry-run]
```

Automates the flow a GitHub release actually needs: an annotated tag, a push
of that tag, and `gh release create` — a plain `git tag` + `git push origin
<tag>` alone does **not** create a visible GitHub Release, that's a separate
API call this always makes.

- The version is either explicit (`v1.3.0`) or derived by bumping the latest
  `vX.Y.Z` tag (`--major`/`--minor`/`--patch`).
- Release notes are either explicit (`--notes "..."`) or left to
  `gh release create --generate-notes` (summarizes PRs/commits since the last
  release) — version and notes are each independently automatic or manual.
- Refuses uncommitted changes (checked with `git status --porcelain`, so
  untracked files count too — not just `git diff --quiet`, which misses
  them) or a current branch that's diverged from its origin tracking branch.
- `-n`/`--dry-run` previews the version and notes source without tagging or
  pushing anything.

---

Genuinely shared logic (the color/step/warn output helpers, base-branch
resolution, PR-range expansion) lives once in `lib/gitplus-common.sh`,
which each command locates relative to its own real path (following the
symlink it's installed as) and sources — not copy-pasted per file. Only
things that are *coincidentally* similar but reasonably diverge per command
stay separate.

## Requirements

- `bash` (works on macOS's bash 3.2)
- `git`
- `gh` (GitHub CLI) — for `git pr`, `git haspr`, and `git release`, and for
  `git sync` only when a target is a PR number or URL (naming branches
  directly needs no `gh`). `install.sh` installs it via Homebrew if missing
  (and prints manual instructions on other platforms); not fatal, so the
  other commands install
  fine without it.

## Notes

- `git sweep` won't catch **squash-merged** branches (a squash isn't an
  ancestor of the base, so `-d` correctly refuses it) — delete those by hand,
  or with `git sweep -f`.
- `git sync` uses `--force-with-lease`, which still refuses to clobber remote
  commits you haven't fetched.
