#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Runs every command under /bin/bash — macOS's bash 3.2 — looking for the one
# failure mode that version has and newer bash doesn't.
#
# Why this exists: under `set -u`, bash 3.2 treats "${arr[@]}" on an EMPTY
# array as an unbound-variable error and dies; bash 4+ returns nothing and
# carries on. So a script that works perfectly on a machine with Homebrew
# bash first on PATH can abort instantly on a stock macOS one. That shipped:
# `gp pr merge -a` died with "line 800: exclude_ids[@]: unbound variable" on
# a second machine while being fine on the development machine, and stayed
# invisible through several releases because every test run here used bash 5.
#
# The fix everywhere is the guarded form ${arr[@]+"${arr[@]}"}. This test
# calls the commands for real (against a stub gh, in a throwaway repo) rather
# than just syntax-checking, because an unbound array only errors when the
# line actually executes.
#
# Run: test/bash32.sh
